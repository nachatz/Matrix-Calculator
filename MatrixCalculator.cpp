/* MATRIX CALCULATOR - DRIVER FILE
 *
 * Driver file for matrix calculator. This program is used to test functionality of the
 * linear algebra calculator. This program was slightly modified to be used in deep learning
 * algorithms and machine learning techniques in C++. The goal of this file is to show that the
 * math and operations work correctly.
